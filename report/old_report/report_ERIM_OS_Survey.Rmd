# Introduction

<!-- The Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers. -->

<!-- Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle -- from hypothesis, methodology, observation, data collection, to analysis and publication --, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. Open Science also enables the creation of new research questions and promotes collaborations and community building. -->

<!-- For these reasons, ERIM wanted to have a baseline on what and how much open science practices its researchers are already engaging with and which ones they want to learn more about. These questions created the need to conduct a survey. -->

<!-- The ESE and RSM Open Science Spring Survey was open to all researchers from the 6th of April to the 6th of May 2021. Questions were adapted from the [Swinburne Open Science Survey](https://osf.io/vpwf7/). -->

<!-- The survey explored how researchers perceive and use open science practices. Eight main topics were covered: -->

<!-- 1. Preregistration -->
<!-- 2. Open materials/code -->
<!-- 3. Open data -->
<!-- 4. Pre-publication archiving -->
<!-- 5. Open access -->
<!-- 6. General experience with open science practices -->
<!-- 7. Awareness of available tools -->
<!-- 8. Role of ERIM -->

<!-- This report displays the combined results (ESE and RSM) as well as separately for each school[^1]. -->

<!-- This is a living document that will be updated with new information and insights. For any comments or questions, please contact [Dr. Lizette Guzman-Ramirez](mailto:guzmanramirez@rsm.nl) (ERIM Research Data Steward) or [Dr. Antonio Schettino](mailto:schettino@eur.nl) (ERS Open Science Coordinator). -->

Finally, researchers were asked *`r ESE_support_expectations$question[1]`*. `r pull(filter(ESE_support_expectations, item == "Yes"), lab_perc)` of respondents said *`r pull(filter(ESE_support_expectations, item == "Yes"), item)`* whereas `r pull(filter(ESE_support_expectations, item == "No"), lab_perc)` said *`r pull(filter(ESE_support_expectations, item == "No"), item)`*.

When specifically asked *`r ESE_support_practice$question[1]`*, the top 3 were:

* *`r ESE_support_practice$item[1]`* (`r ESE_support_practice[1, "lab_perc"]`)

# Strategy towards an open science culture at ERIM

Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. For these reasons, ERIM is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers.

Between 2021 and 2023, ERIM will execute a three-year Open Science initiative, geared towards making our scientific routines more open and engaged with our scholarly and societal stakeholders. 

This initiative will focus on researcher behaviour and on stimulating the active use of open science tools and infrastructure. 

In March 2021, ERIM kicked off this initiative with the ORCiD Madness Month, followed by the Open Science Spring Survey during the month of April. Later in the autumn, ERIM will continue with the October DataFest and develop an Open Science Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) for researchers and support staff (funded by Stepping Up Professional Services).

The ORCiD Madness Month brought to light the importance of having a unique identifier to your research profile and, as a result, we saw an increase of 72 new ORCiD accounts created between ESE and RSM researchers. 

The Open Science Spring Survey was then conducted to gather a baseline on the Open Science practices our researchers are already engaging on, and to understand which practices they want to learn more about.

The lessons learned from the survey and how will the be tackled are the following: 

**Preregistration**: researchers think is important but only a few are regularly preregistering their research, so we will have a module about it in the Open Science MOOC where we will have examples on how to preregister and we will also tackle researchers' concerns.

**Open materials and/or code and data**: researchers find this very important, this is why we decided to use the whole month of October dedicated to open data. The ERIM October DataFest is intended to bring awareness on open data and promote the use of the Erasmus Data Repository (EDR). One of the events of the DataFest will tackle the top 5 concerns on open materials, code, and data that were reported in this survey.

**Pre-publication**: researchers think is very important to quickly disseminate their results, but only a small percentage of them are using pre-prints, and a large percentage of respondents were not aware of them. To tackle this, we will add a module on pre-publication archiving in the Open Science MOOC where we will explain its benefits, how to do it, and we will also tackle respondents' concerns. 

**Open Access**: a small percentage of respondents have all their publication open access. Fortunately for ERIM and the EUR, this percentage will change in the coming months/years, since EUR's researchers have agreed to follow the Taverne amendment, ensuring that any publication that is not already open access will be made open (by law) after 6 months of its publication. We will provide more detail in a dedicated module on open access in our Open Science MOOC.

**Open Science practices**: the most relevant barrier to open science (excluding open access, because of the Taverne amendment) is the lack of recognition in the field and lack of credit by the institution. There is a lot of effort on this front: ERIM is redesigning its membership chart to include open science, funding agencies now require various forms of commitment to open science practices, and EUR has a whole task force that is also redesigning rewards and recognition for its researchers. 

All in all, ERIM has started the year 2021 with a new strategy in place: to make open science the norm among its researchers.
