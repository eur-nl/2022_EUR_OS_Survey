# Introduction

The Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers.

Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle -- from hypothesis, methodology, observation, data collection, to analysis and publication --, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. Open Science also enables the creation of new research questions and promotes collaborations and community building.

For these reasons, ERIM wanted to have a baseline on what and how much open science practices its researchers are already engaging with and which ones they want to learn more about. These questions created the need to conduct a survey.

The ESE and RSM Open Science Spring Survey was open to all researchers from the 6th of April to the 6th of May 2021. Questions were adapted from the [Swinburne Open Science Survey](https://osf.io/vpwf7/).

The survey explored how researchers perceive and use open science practices. Eight main topics were covered:

1. Preregistration
2. Open materials/code
3. Open data
4. Pre-publication archiving
5. Open access
6. General experience with open science practices
7. Awareness of available tools
8. Role of ERIM

This report has all the total responses (combined ESE and RSM)[^1].

This is a living document that will be updated with new information and insights. For any comments or questions, please contact [Dr. Lizette Guzman-Ramirez](mailto:guzmanramirez@rsm.nl) (ERIM Research Data Steward) or [Dr. Antonio Schettino](mailto:schettino@eur.nl) (ERS Open Science Coordinator).

```{r load-clean-data}

ERIM_OS_clean <-

```

# Respondents

```{r complete-questionnaires-data}

ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished <- 
  ERIM_OS_clean %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>%
  summarize(survey = length(which(Finished == TRUE))/length(Finished)) %>%
  count(survey) %>% 
  mutate(
    survey = ifelse(survey == 0, "incomplete", "complete"),

    lab_perc = paste(round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2), "%", sep = "") # percentage as text (for plot labels)
  )

```

A total of `r sum(ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished$n)` respondents started the survey, and `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished, survey == "complete"), n)` completed it.

```{r affiliation-data}

ERIM_OS_demographics <-
  read_csv(
    here("data", "preproc", "cluster0.csv")
  )

```

We asked participants their school, department, and research institute affiliation, together with their position.

`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Rotterdam School of Management (RSM)"), lab_perc)` of the respondents were from RSM, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Erasmus School of Economics (ESE)"), lab_perc)` were affiliated to ESE. For the percentages regarding the affiliation of respondents per department, see Figure \@ref(fig:figure1).

```{r figure1, fig.cap = "Affilliation per department.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure1.png"))

```

Regarding institute affiliation, the majority of respondents (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "ERIM"), lab_perc)`) were affiliated to ERIM, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Tinbergen"), lab_perc)` were affiliated to Tinbergen, `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Neither"), lab_perc)` to neither institute, and `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "ERIM,Tinbergen"), lab_perc)` to both.

# Preregistration

```{r preregistration-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration <-
  read_csv(
    here("data", "preproc", "cluster2.csv")
  )

```

```{r preregistration-importance-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "In your opinion, how important for your field is it that researchers preregister their studies?")

```

The answers to the question *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance$question[1]`* reveal that respondents consider preregistration *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance$item[1]`* or *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance$item[2]`* (`r paste0(sum(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance[1, "perc"], ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance[2, "perc"]), "%")`), while `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance, item == "Not at all important"), "perc"), "%")` believe that preregistration is *`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance, item == "Not at all important"), item)`*.

```{r preregistration-experience-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "What is your experience with study preregistration?")

```

From the question *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience$question[1]`*, we see that most respondents (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "I am aware of study preregistration, but have not used it in my research"), lab_perc)`) are aware of preregistration but have not used it in their own projects. `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "I regularly preregister my studies"), lab_perc)` of the respondents regularly preregister their studies, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "Until now, I was unaware of study preregistration"), lab_perc)` had never heard of preregistration before answering this survey. More details can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:figure2).

```{r figure2, fig.cap = "Preregistration: importance vs. experience.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure2.png"))

```

```{r preregistration-concerns-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about preregistering their studies. Which of these concerns would apply to you?") %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc))

```

Among the possible concerns that researchers could have about preregistering their studies, the top 3 were: 

* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[1]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[1, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[2]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[2, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[3]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[3, "lab_perc"]`)

<!-- These are your old top 3, which are different from mine because I am using complete surveys only -->
<!-- Could you please verify that everything makes sense? -->

<!-- 25.66% - I need to look at my data before I can decide how to best analyze it. -->
<!-- 20.35% - Preregistration might lead to other people taking my research idea and implementing my plan. -->
<!-- 19.47% - Preregistration prevents exploratory research. -->

# Open materials/code

```{r materials-data}

ERIM_OS_materials <-
  read_csv(

  )

```

```{r materials-importance-data}

ERIM_OS_materials_importance <-
  ERIM_OS_materials %>% 
  filter(question == "In your opinion, how important for your field is it that materials and/or code are openly available?")

```

From the question *`r ERIM_OS_materials_importance$question[1]`*, we can see that `r paste0(format(sum(ERIM_OS_materials_importance[1, "perc"], ERIM_OS_materials_importance[2, "perc"], ERIM_OS_materials_importance[3, "perc"]), digits = 0), "%")` of respondents think that using open materials and/or code is *`r ERIM_OS_materials_importance$item[1]`*, *`r ERIM_OS_materials_importance$item[2]`*, or *`r ERIM_OS_materials_importance$item[3]`*, whereas `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_importance, item == "Not at all important"), "perc"), "%")` think it is *`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_importance, item == "Not at all important"), item)`* (see Figure \@ref(fig:figure4).)

```{r figure4, fig.cap = "Open materials and/or code: importance.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure4.png"))

```

```{r materials-use-data}

ERIM_OS_materials_use <-
  ERIM_OS_materials %>% 
  filter(question == "What is your experience with using open materials and/or code?")

```

The answers to the question *`r ERIM_OS_materials_use$question[1]`* reveal that (`r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_use, item == "I am aware of open materials and/or code, but have not used it in my research"), "perc"), "%")`) of respondents are aware of open materials but do not use them, and that (`r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_use, item == "I have some experience with open materials and/or code, but do not use them regularly"), "perc"), "%")`) have some experience using open materials and/or code. A considerable amount of researchers (`r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_use, item == "I regularly use and/or create open materials and/or code"), "perc"), "%")`) regularly use open materials and/or code, while only a small fraction of respondents (`r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_use, item == "Until now, I hadn't heard of open materials and/or code"), "perc"), "%")`) had not heard of open materials and/or code before answering this survey. 

```{r materials-sharing-data}

ERIM_OS_materials_sharing <-
  ERIM_OS_materials %>% 
  filter(question == "What is your experience with sharing open materials and/or code?")

```

From the question *`r ERIM_OS_materials_sharing$question[1]`* we can see that `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_sharing, item == "I am aware of open materials and/or code, but have not shared my own"), "perc"), "%")` of respondents are aware of sharing materials and/or code, `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_sharing, item == "I have some experience with open materials and/or code, but do not share mine regularly"), "perc"), "%")` have some experience, and `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_sharing, item == "I regularly share open materials and/or code"), "perc"), "%")` regularly share open materials and/or code.

Based on these results, we observe that researchers at ESE and RSM share their materials and/or code more than what they re-use. More details can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:figure5).

```{r figure5, fig.cap = "Open materials and/or code: using vs. sharing.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure5.png"))

```{r materials-concerns-data}

ERIM_OS_materials_concerns <-
  ERIM_OS_materials %>% 
  filter(question == "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about making their materials and/or code openly available. Which of these concerns would apply to you?") %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc))

```

Among the possible concerns that researchers could have about making their materials and/or code openly available, the top 3 were: 

* *`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns$item[2]`* (`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns[2, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns$item[3]`* (`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns[3, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns$item[4]`* (`r ERIM_OS_materials_concerns[4, "lab_perc"]`)

Notably, however, the majority of respondents (`r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_materials_concerns, item == "I do not share any of these concerns"), "perc"), "%")`) did not share any of the listed concerns (see Figure \@ref(fig:figure6)).

```{r figure6, fig.cap = "Open materials and/or code: concerns.", out.width = '100%'}

From the question *`r ERIM_OS_data_sharing$question[1]`* we can see that `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_data_sharing, item == "I am aware of open data, but have not shared my data"), "perc"), "%")` of respondents are aware of sharing data, `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_data_sharing, item == "I have some experience sharing open data, but not regularly"), "perc"), "%")` have some experience, and `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_data_sharing, item == "I regularly share open data"), "perc"), "%")` regularly share open data.

Based on these results, it seems that researchers at ESE and RSM have more experience using publicly available data rather than sharing their own data. More details can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:figure8).

ERIM_OS_tools <-
  read_csv(

We asked researchers to indicate their awareness of some popular open science resources. Notably, services hosted or approved by EUR are frequently in use, for example Dropbox for Business (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_tools, question == "EUR Dropbox (not personal)" & item == "I use this"), lab_perc)`), SurfDrive (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_tools, question == "EUR SurfDrive" & item == "I use this"), lab_perc)`), and EUR RePub (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_tools, question == "EUR RePub" & item == "I use this"), lab_perc)`). An overview of all responses can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:figure14).

# Strategy towards an open science culture at ERIM

Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. For these reasons, ERIM is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers.

Between 2021 and 2023, ERIM will execute a three-year Open Science initiative, geared towards making our scientific routines more open and engaged with our scholarly and societal stakeholders. 

This initiative will focus on researcher behaviour and on stimulating the active use of open science tools and infrastructure. 

In March 2021, ERIM kicked off this initiative with the ORCiD Madness Month, followed by the Open Science Spring Survey during the month of April. Later in the autumn, ERIM will continue with the October DataFest and develop an Open Science Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) for researchers and support staff (funded by Stepping Up Professional Services).

The ORCiD Madness Month brought to light the importance of having a unique identifier to your research profile and, as a result, we saw an increase of 72 new ORCiD accounts created between ESE and RSM researchers. 

The Open Science Spring Survey was then conducted to gather a baseline on the Open Science practices our researchers are already engaging on, and to understand which practices they want to learn more about.

The lessons learned from the survey and how will the be tackled are the following: 

**Preregistration**: researchers think is important but only a few are regularly preregistering their research, so we will have a module about it in the Open Science MOOC where we will have examples on how to preregister and we will also tackle researchers' concerns.

**Open materials and/or code and data**: researchers find this very important, this is why we decided to use the whole month of October dedicated to open data. The ERIM October DataFest is intended to bring awareness on open data and promote the use of the Erasmus Data Repository (EDR). One of the events of the DataFest will tackle the top 5 concerns on open materials, code, and data that were reported in this survey.

**Pre-publication**: researchers think is very important to quickly disseminate their results, but only a small percentage of them are using pre-prints, and a large percentage of respondents were not aware of them. To tackle this, we will add a module on pre-publication archiving in the Open Science MOOC where we will explain its benefits, how to do it, and we will also tackle respondents' concerns. 

**Open Access**: a small percentage of respondents have all their publication open access. Fortunately for ERIM and the EUR, this percentage will change in the coming months/years, since EUR's researchers have agreed to follow the Taverne amendment, ensuring that any publication that is not already open access will be made open (by law) after 6 months of its publication. We will provide more detail in a dedicated module on open access in our Open Science MOOC.

**Open Science practices**: the most relevant barrier to open science (excluding open access, because of the Taverne amendment) is the lack of recognition in the field and lack of credit by the institution. There is a lot of effort on this front: ERIM is redesigning its membership chart to include open science, funding agencies now require various forms of commitment to open science practices, and EUR has a whole task force that is also redesigning rewards and recognition for its researchers. 

All in all, ERIM has started the year 2021 with a new strategy in place: to make open science the norm among its researchers.
