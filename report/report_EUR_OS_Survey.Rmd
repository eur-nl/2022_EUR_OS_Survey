# Introduction {#intro}

Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle -- hypothesis, methodology, observation, data collection, analysis, and publication --, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. Open Science also enables the creation of new research questions and promotes collaboration and community building.

Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers.

In order to have a baseline assessment on current awareness and practices, the [Open and Responsible Science program](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/research/research-services/open-responsible-science?check_logged_in=1) conducted a survey and advertised it to all researchers at EUR and Erasmus MC.

The EUR Open Science Survey (adapted from the [Swinburne Open Science Survey](https://osf.io/vpwf7/) and the [2021 ERIM Open Science Spring Survey](https://eur-nl.github.io/2021_ERIM_OS_Survey/)) was available online from January to March 2022.

The survey explored how researchers consider open science practices in the context of their discipline, their direct experience, as well as their concerns. Seven topics were covered:

1. [Open Access](#oa)
2. [Open Data, Materials, and/or Code](#open-materials)
3. [Preregistration](#prereg)
4. [Open Education](#open-education)
5. [Societal Engagement](#society)
6. [Support at EUR](#support)
7. [Recognition and Rewards](#rr)

The current report shows the combined results as well as separately for each school.

A total of `r sum(EUR_OS_incomplete$n)` respondents started the survey, and `r pull(filter(EUR_OS_incomplete, survey == "complete"), n)` completed it (`r pull(filter(EUR_OS_incomplete, survey == "complete"), lab_perc)`).
 
Considering only the completed surveys, Figure \@ref(fig:figure-school-position) shows the percentage of respondents separately for each school and position. Table \@ref(tab:table-school-position-response-rate) shows the percentage of respondents relative to the total number of employees.

# Conclusions

Open Science increases transparency throughout the research cycle, resulting in increased research efficiency and enhanced research quality, visibility, and engagement. For these reasons, EUR is committed to making Open Science practices the norm among its researchers. It is no surprise that Open and Responsible Science (ORS) is one of the pillars for the EUR strategy 2024.

The first deliverable of the Open and Responsible Science Program is the Open Science initiative, geared towards making our scientific routines more open and engaged with our scholarly and societal stakeholders. This initiative will focus on researcher behavior and on stimulating the active use of open science tools and infrastructure.

The ORS program has also together withe Open Science Ambassadors of each faculty co-created an Open Science white paper that presents the current state of Open Science at EUR and future plans. 

Also, this survey was an initiative of the ORS program, in order to gather information on what our researchers struggle with and what practices do they want to know more about. 

The Open and Responsible Science program will also promote and encourage the Open Science Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) created and developed by members of EUR. 

To recognize and reward Open Science practices, the ORS program created the Open Science Awards, that will be given for the first time on November 2022. 

When it comes to faculty specif strategy, the ORS program group would be happy to provide support and advice to increase the awareness and training regarding Open Science practices. 

The main take away of this survey is that most researchers want support for Open Access Publishing. The EUR library has been instrumental in providing support regarding Open Access, they have information sessions and provide one-to-one support to all EUR researchers, more information on the services can be provided here (https://www.eur.nl/en/library/research-support/open-access).
