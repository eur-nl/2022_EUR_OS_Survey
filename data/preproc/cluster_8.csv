Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"it would be helpful to gradually learn more about it, in a lean and fun manner. Lectures and discussions forums, or very long instruction documents are not the best solution, in my opinion. Sth as the dilemma game is more appealing and a good learning tool to start with. If then people want to learn more, an online instruction video could work. Thanks for the interest.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"I love the idea of publicly sharing research, but find it difficult. My most academic research is conducted in my free time. How can EUR or anyone else claim my data.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"I don't trust quality of papers that are published in open access journals (if you have to pay article charges). From a journal perspective it is fee for article payment, the more article the better (irrespective of the quality)..",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,I believe there are a lot of challenges in science that could be solved by promoting Open Science practices. I currently foresee two major barriers (for myself): (1) misaligned incentives and (2) unawareness of the procedures,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"OS always feels like a whole lot of extra work without any reward, in a field notorious for enormous work pressure and long working hours. I don't feel the urge to spend more evening/weekend hours on helping others with my data.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"Open Science is, also in this survey, portrayed as an allround good thing, however it does not fit well with qualitative research methods, and might enhance inequalities amongst reseachers (eg when funds obligate open access publications but scholars are not covered for the APCs)",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"I feel that sometimes EUR promotes Open Science as a goal in itself. To me and other researchers, it is a means towards an end. This leads to confusion/miscommunication",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"For Question 15, I miss the option “I have some experience with open educational resources by others, but do not use them on the basis of whether or not they are open resources.” For Question 19, I miss the option “I have experience of engaging with society but do not regard it as an aim in itself.”",1,0.63,0.63%

Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"I think it is really important to not pretend as if all research is social science that has a clear methodology. In philosophy for instance, but also in qualitative research that is not always the case. I think it is important to strenghten people's attitudes rather than impose very specific procedures that might then reproduce existing inequalities between different research practices.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,A number of these OS practices - especially making data/code available requires a lot of time and potentially comes at the cost of research/other activities. I tend to do this when a journal demands it.,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,the largest problem with open access of your data 9especially survey data) is the risk that someone else takes the data and constructs quite different scales that violate the whole idea of the research. then you have the risk that someone publishes with the same data a completly different idea. And i also strongly dislike the fact that someone who is good in statitics takes the data for which no investments are made and then publishes. So in my view the researchers that collect the data should have veto power and be co-author,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"I underline the importance of open science and appreciate the effort the EUR takes in promoting Open Science. I joined the OSCR and see that they regularly organize very relevant workshops etc. Daily (busy) practice and the 'scientific system' , however are, off course hard to change and still provide various barriers for the implementation/adoption of open science",1,0.63,0.63%

Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,In the survey it unclear whether the open science is for reseachers who publsh themselves or also for professionals like me to consult for relevant data/information for the best support,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"The EUR could be at the forefront of open science if it would not only support or recommend responsible research practices, but require them through policy.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"It is quite complex to do this well if you do this for the first time, and guidance and assistance in this respect is lacking.",1,0.63,0.63%

Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,The Open Access fund was cancelled - this directly impacts to what extend we can publish open access in certain journals except if you are a PI with lots of money. I don't understand this in light of the current policy.,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,Open science exists for a very long time in the form of working papers. I prepublish all my work as a working paper and make the data available. There is hardly any reward for this,1,0.63,0.63%

Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"YES. To my mind we talk about responsible open science. Far too little concern for the research participants in your qustions, that anyhow seem to modelled on quant research.",1,0.63,0.63%

Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,The work load is huge. You can't expect people to do all the extra work without giving them time to do it. Make procedures easy and convenient.,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"The big problem with open access publications is the funding. I do my best to make what I can open, but sometimes a great journal would accept your work but the open access option is very costly. The previous funding support by EUR was really great in this sense. I think it increases impact and citations.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"Be aware of differences between disciplines, no one size fits all, inclusion in Pure should not be linked to open access, open access is a right of the employee and should not be turned into an obligation set by university on the employee (especially given that the EUR interprets article 25 Auteurswet so extensively, that employees are forced to break rules that publisher set. And please do note: article 25fa Aueteurswet does not apply if an emplyee has a contract with a foreign published under foreign law (we were told otherwise by the UB during an information session on open access, but that was legally incorrect information). And last bur not least: the EUR must be transparent on its open access obligations: why is the open access policy only accessible to employees and not to the outside world (including prospective employees who want to know what their obligations would be if they would become employees of the EUR? That does not fit with open access.",1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,Not all open science practices are equally relevant to all forms of research. It would be helpful if this is acknowledged. E.g. theoretical research without empirical components has a different relationship to open data etc.,1,0.63,0.63%
Is there anything else you would like to mention about Open Science practices?,"more information and an insightful/comprehensive discussion with all actors involved (without excluding research from this) is needed in order to accurately and fully evaluate all the potential positive/negative implications of open science with a view to define and pursue a reasonable, realistic and effective open science policy",1,0.63,0.63%
